3 Main Properties Of The Einstein Summation
There are three main properties of the Einstein summation that is used in advanced mathematics and physics for brevity.

They are:

-Summation is carried over for indices that are repeated
-The limit for the appearance of each index is two
-Each term of the Einstein Summation can at most have two identical index
